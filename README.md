## Speak Friend, and Enter! ðŸ––

Welcome to my github! My name is Sarah Baskin (she/her) and I am a Junior at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA studying Computer Science and Linguistics. I am working toward a specialization in Natural Language Processing/Computational Linguistics, but I am open to work in SWE, PM, and really anything under the sun so long as it involves computing and working with people :). In my spare time, I enjoy reading (currently digging into The Kitchen God's Wife by Amy Tan), crocheting, and watching Star Trek.

### Break Through Tech AI

This past semester I have had the honor of participating in Break Through Tech AI @ MIT's program for women and non-binary individuals in Computer Science. As part of the process, I was paired for a Fall internship with Darshana, Inc. An AI startup based in the Boston area. Darshana's goal is to provide verifiable applicant credential tokens that can be used to suggest ideal candidates to job postings. This will not only help to fix the current recruitment crisis in the tech industry and beyond, but will also enable clients to own their own job data.

Our project was focused on comparing the quality of Darshana's verified applicant entries against un-verified options. Our analysis found that the two datasets were too similar to produce differences in job recommendations.

you can find more information about the project in the pinned repo on my profile.

### Personal Projects (listed in order of current percentage completion)

#### FINISHED: The Eras Tour: Investigating the Validity of Music Sentiment Analysis through the Case Study of Taylor Swift (Analyzing-The-Eras-Tour)
The purview of sentiment analysis is slowly widening, with new applications being found in poetry, literature, and music. However, the literature on this aspect of SA is generally very contradictory, and the findings often weak, unsupportable, or incomplete. Here, I use the most pertinent research on the topic of sentiment analysis in music to conduct a study analyzing the evolution of the music of Taylor Swift (chosen because she an artist who the public perceives to have had distinct sentimental 'eras' in her body of work. The goal is to use this case study and the refined techniques that I have taken from other work in order to try and see if SA can actually be applied to music research.

#### ACTIVELY IN PROGRESS: [Re]Release (-Re-Release)
A movie recommendation application

#### Transportivity (Transportivity)
An application that will allow MBTA users to locate the fastest and cheapest public transit trip from point A to point B.

#### "Why did I Learn French in School?": The Most Useful Second Langauges to Teach in School (second-langs-in-massachusetts)
It is often just assumed that the languages offered in school are the most useful options for kids to get accustomed to. But what if that wasn't the case? Here, I will explore the question of what exactly is the "best" second language for people in Massachusetts specifically to learn. What langauges will give you the best bang for your buck? What languages are you most likely (statistically speaking) to come in contact with? Data analysis will consider immigrant populations, ex-pat countries that Massachusettsians are most likely to seek out, and various other demographic data.
